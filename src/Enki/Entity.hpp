		/*Every x ticks the entity will be automatically serialized via serializeOnTick
		The real time delay between ticks is dependant on the Network Manager's network_send_rate
		With a network_send_rate of 60 and a network_tick_rate of 1, this entity is serialized 60 times a second.
		With a network_tick_rate of 10, this entity is serialized 6 times a second.
		With a network_tick_rate of 0, this entity is never serialized automatically at regular intervals.

		Using network_send_rate as part of a formula can allow for specifying the real-time delay between serialization
		e.g. network_tick_rate = network_send_rate / 10.0f, for roughly 10 serializations per second (depending on integer truncation).
		This relies on the network_send_rate not being modified after the network_tick_rate is set*/
